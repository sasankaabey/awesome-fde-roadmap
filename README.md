Forward Deployment Engineering is the art of shipping complex software where it matters most. It is a hybrid role—part **Software Engineer**, part **AI/Data Architect**, and part **Strategic Consultant**. 

FDEs are the "Technical Special Ops" who bridge the gap (The Delta) between a core product and a client’s messy, real-world reality.

> 🎓 **Want to work through this instead of just reading it?** The **[FDE Field Course](course/README.md)** turns this roadmap into 12 modules, each with concepts, hands-on labs, out-loud articulation drills, and "drive it at work" assignments that build a full deployment package for a real initiative.

## 🛸 The FDE Persona & Mission
The FDE is the **bridge** between the "Perfect Code" of HQ and the "Messy Reality" of the Client.

*   **The Problem:** Standard software often fails when it hits real-world data (corrupt schemas, air-gapped servers, political resistance).
*   **The Solution:** The FDE. They don't just "fix bugs"—they architect solutions, manage stakeholders, and write the "glue code" that makes a multi-million dollar contract successful.

In traditional Software Engineering (SWE), you build for a "user persona". In FDE, you build for a **mission**.

| Feature | Software Engineer (SWE) | Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User** | Millions of anonymous users | High-stakes stakeholders (CTOs, Generals, CEOs) |
| **Environment** | Controlled, uniform cloud | Hostile, legacy, air-gapped, or hybrid infra |
| **Goal** | Scale and stability | Speed-to-value and problem-solving |
| **Code Ratio** | 90% Features | 50% Integration/Glue, 50% Strategy |

### 🛠 The Modern FDE Stack

#### Core Tools
*   **Languages:** `Python` (Data/AI), `Go` (Infra), `SQL` (Everything).
*   **Data:** `dbt` (Transformation), `DuckDB` (Local processing), `Apache Spark`.
*   **Cloud:** `Terraform` (IaC), `Helm` (K8s packaging), `GCP`.
*   **Observability:** `Prometheus`, `Grafana`, `Loki`.

---

### 🎓 The Master Curriculum

### Phase 1: Data Engineering (The Bedrock)
*The FDE mission usually starts with a "Data Audit". If you can't untangle a client’s 20-year-old schema, you can't build on top of it.*

*   **Advanced SQL & Query Tuning:** Beyond `JOINs`. You must master Window Functions, Recursive CTEs, and Query Optimization. You should be able to look at an EXPLAIN plan and identify why a query is scanning 10TB of data unnecessarily.
*   **Data Modeling for Reality:** Understand **Star Schema** vs. **One Big Table (OBT)**. Learn to design schemas that balance write-performance with user-readability.
*   **The Medallion Architecture:** 
    *   **Bronze:** Raw landing zone (immutable).
    *   **Silver:** Filtered, joined, and cleaned (the "Single Source of Truth").
    *   **Gold:** Business-ready aggregates (Powering the UI/AI).
*   **Distributed Computing:** Understanding **Spark/Ray** partitioning. You must know how to debug "Data Skew" and "OOM (Out of Memory)" errors when processing client datasets that exceed local memory.
*   **Data Quality & Observability:** Implementing "Circuit Breakers" for data. If a client's upstream data breaks, your pipeline should alert you before the CEO sees a broken dashboard.

#### 📚 Phase 1 Resources
*   **[Select Star SQL](https://selectstarsql.com/):** An interactive book to master SQL through real-world data.
*   **[Designing Data-Intensive Applications (DDIA)](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/):** The "Bible" for understanding how data systems actually work under the hood.
*   **[dbt Fundamentals](https://courses.getdbt.com/courses/fundamentals):** The standard for turning "Data Engineering" into "Analytics Engineering".
*   **[DuckDB for FDEs](https://duckdb.org/docs/):** A critical tool for fast, local analysis of client CSV/Parquet files without setting up a full cluster.

---

### Phase 2: Cloud Architecture & Infrastructure (The Vehicle)
*FDEs are often "dropped" into complex cloud environments. You must move beyond writing code to architecting the "Landing Zone" where that code lives. Using **GCP** as our standard, you must master how to securely deploy and scale within a client's project.*

*   **Cloud Networking & Security (VPC Mastery):**
    *   **The Global VPC:** Understanding GCP’s unique global networking. Mastering **Shared VPCs** to allow multiple teams to use a single network.
    *   **Secure Connectivity:** Implementing **Cloud Interconnect** or **Cloud VPN** to bridge a client's on-prem data center to GCP.
    *   **Zero-Trust:** Using **Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)** to grant access to internal apps without a VPN.
*   **Kubernetes as a Standard (GKE):**
    *   **GKE Autopilot vs. Standard:** Knowing when to trade control for operational ease.
    *   **Workload Identity:** The gold standard for security—allowing GKE service accounts to act as IAM service accounts without managing JSON keys.
    *   **Private Clusters:** Deploying GKE without public IP addresses to satisfy strict enterprise security requirements.
*   **Data Architecture on GCP:**
    *   **BigQuery Integration:** Designing schemas for BigQuery (Clustering vs. Partitioning) to handle petabyte-scale analysis for clients.
    *   **Serverless Pipelines:** Using **Cloud Functions** or **Cloud Run** for lightweight, event-driven data processing.
    *   **Pub/Sub:** Architecting real-time streaming "glue" between client systems and your platform.
*   **Data Exfiltration Prevention (VPC Service Controls):**
    *   FDEs in high-security sectors (Finance/Gov) must master **VPC SC**. This defines a security perimeter around Google-managed services to prevent data from being moved to unauthorized projects.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform):**
    *   Automating the entire "FDE Environment". If you can’t spin up a GKE cluster, a BigQuery dataset, and an IAM policy in 5 minutes via Terraform, you aren't ready to deploy "forward".

#### 📚 Phase 2 Resources (GCP Focused)
*   **[Google Cloud Architecture Framework](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/framework):** The definitive guide to building secure, resilient, and cost-effective systems on GCP.
*   **[GKE Networking Deep Dive](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/network-overview):** Essential reading for understanding how traffic flows inside a cluster.
*   **[Terraform Provider for Google Cloud](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs):** The documentation you will live in daily.
*   **[Google Cloud "Skills Boost" (Data Engineer Path)](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/16):** Hands-on labs for BigQuery and Dataflow.
*   **[VPC Service Controls (VPC SC) Explained](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/overview):** A critical skill for FDEs working with sensitive enterprise data.
*   **[Google SRE Workbook](https://sre.google/workbook/table-of-contents/):** Specifically the "Monitoring" and "Incident Response" chapters to keep client deployments alive.

---

### Phase 3: The Consulting Mindset (The "Forward" in FDE)
*An FDE is a "Technical Diplomat". You must solve the people problems to allow the technical solutions to work.*

*   **Structured Problem Solving (MECE):** Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive. Break a massive "AI Strategy" into small, non-overlapping technical tasks.
*   **The Pyramid Principle:** Start with the answer first. Executives want the "So What?" before the technical "How".
*   **80/20 Value Scoping:** Identify the 20% of features that will solve 80% of the client's pain. Avoid "Gold-Plating" (building complex features no one asked for).
*   **The Art of the Discovery Call:** Learning to ask "Why?" five times to find the root cause of a business problem.
*   **Requirements Translation:** Turning a CEO's "I want more efficiency" into a Jira Ticket for "Optimizing Route Pathfinding Algorithm".

#### 📚 Phase 3 Resources
*   **[The Trusted Advisor](https://trustedadvisor.com/books/the-trusted-advisor):** How to move from being a "vendor" to a "partner".
*   **[The Pyramid Principle (Summary)](https://medium.com/lessons-from-mckinsey/the-pyramid-principle-f0885dd3c5c7):** The gold standard for executive communication.
*   **[How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034):** Sounds cliché, but vital for dealing with resistant IT staff at client sites.
*   **[The McKinsey Way](https://www.amazon.com/McKinsey-Way-Ethan-M-Rasiel/dp/0070534489):** Frameworks for thinking about business problems like an engineer.

### 🐝 Multi-Agent Orchestration with Google ADK
The **[Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://github.com/google/adk-docs)** is Google’s open-source, code-first framework for building sophisticated multi-agent systems. It treats agent development like **software engineering**, providing modularity, hierarchy, and deterministic control.

#### ADK Core Primitives
*   **Multi-Agent by Design:** Compose specialized agents in a hierarchy (e.g., a "Manager" delegating to "Researcher" and "Coder" agents).
*   **The Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol:** An open standard that allows agents to discover and communicate with each other via consistent HTTP-based interfaces.
*   **Model Agnostic:** While optimized for Gemini, ADK uses **LiteLLM** to support GPT-4o, Claude, and Mistral.
*   **Deployment:** Native integration with **[Agent Runtime on Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/scale)** (formerly Vertex AI Agent Engine) for managed, auto-scaling production deployment of ADK, LangChain, LangGraph, and other framework agents. In practice, most FDE teams drive this through **Agents CLI** (below) rather than hand-rolling Terraform.

#### 🧰 Agents CLI (Launched at Google Cloud Next '26)
Announced on **April 22, 2026** at Google Cloud Next '26 (Alpha), the **[Agents CLI](https://google.github.io/agents-cli/guide/getting-started/)** is Google's opinionated lifecycle tool for ADK on Google Cloud — scaffold, eval, deploy, publish, observe. It's **not** a replacement for your AI coding tool (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Codex, Antigravity); it's a skills package that *turns those tools into ADK experts* by shipping seven domain-specific skills that the coding agent auto-discovers:

| Skill | What it covers |
| :--- | :--- |
| `google-agents-cli-workflow` | Always-active orchestrator — lifecycle, code-preservation rules, model selection |
| `google-agents-cli-scaffold` | `agents-cli create` / `enhance` / `upgrade` — project bootstrap with `DESIGN_SPEC.md`, tests, and eval sets |
| `google-agents-cli-adk-code` | ADK Python API patterns — agents, tools, callbacks, state, orchestration |
| `google-agents-cli-eval` | Eval datasets, LLM-as-judge, tool-trajectory scoring, `agents-cli eval run` / `eval compare` |
| `google-agents-cli-deploy` | Deploy targets: **Agent Runtime**, **Cloud Run**, **GKE**. Handles service accounts, secrets, rollback |
| `google-agents-cli-publish` | Register agents with **Gemini Enterprise** / **Agent Registry** (ADK or A2A modes) |
| `google-agents-cli-observability` | Cloud Trace, prompt-response logging, BigQuery Agent Analytics, third-party integrations (AgentOps, Phoenix, MLflow) |

**Why FDEs should care:** the tool bridges the local-prototype → cloud-production gap that historically required stitching together `gcloud`, Terraform, and hand-written CI. Two ways to drive it — through a coding agent, or standalone from your terminal:

```bash
# One-time install (Python 3.11+, uv, Node.js required)
uvx google-agents-cli setup

# Coding-agent flow: launch Claude Code / Gemini CLI / Codex / Antigravity and prompt it —
#   "Use agents-cli to scaffold a finance agent that summarizes expense reports,
#    deploy it to Agent Runtime, and publish it to Gemini Enterprise."

# Standalone terminal flow (from the Google Developers Blog launch post):
agents-cli create finance-agent -y --deployment-target agent_runtime   # scaffold
cd finance-agent
agents-cli eval run                                                    # run evals
agents-cli eval compare evals/run_v1.json evals/run_v2.json            # compare runs
agents-cli infra single-project                                        # provision GCP infra
agents-cli deploy                                                      # ship to Agent Runtime
agents-cli publish gemini-enterprise                                   # register with Gemini Enterprise
```

Cloud Trace is on by default. Additional observability (service account, GCS bucket, BigQuery dataset for full prompt-response logging) can be provisioned by prompting the coding agent to "set up observability infrastructure."

**Requirements:** Python 3.11+, `uv`, Node.js (for skills install). Optional for deploy: Google Cloud SDK, Terraform. Platform support: macOS, Linux, and Windows (WSL 2 — native Windows not officially supported).

---

### ⚖️ LLM Systems Evaluation (The Success Key)
FDEs don't just "vibes-test" their agents; they use a two-loop evaluation framework to prove reliability to the client.

#### 1. The Inner Loop (Dev-Time Evaluation with ADK)
Focuses on fast, manual, and interactive debugging during development.
*   **`adk eval`:** A CLI and Web UI tool to test execution paths against "Golden Datasets".
*   **Metrics:** `tool_trajectory_avg_score` (Did it use the right tools?), `response_match_score` (ROUGE similarity), and `rubric_based_final_response_quality`.

#### 2. The Outer Loop (Production Evaluation on Agent Platform)
Scalable, automated evaluation for high-volume production data and CI/CD integration. FDEs use this to prove that a model update or a prompt change is a measurable improvement across thousands of test cases.

*   **[Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform Evals](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/computation-based-eval-pipeline)** (formerly Vertex AI Gen AI Evaluation Service): The unified service for both **Rapid Evaluation** (synchronous, for dev/test) and **Pipeline Evaluation** (asynchronous, for massive datasets).
*   **Pairwise Evaluation (The evolution of AutoSxS):** A "Model-as-a-Judge" approach. It uses a superior model (e.g., Gemini 3 Pro) as an autorater to compare two model responses (Model A vs. Model B) based on a specific rubric, providing win rates and detailed explanations for every "judgment."
*   **Pointwise Evaluation (The RAG Triad):** Assessing single model responses against specific quality dimensions using the **Rapid Eval API**:
    *   **Groundedness:** Does the response strictly follow the retrieved context? (Crucial for eliminating hallucinations).
    *   **Fulfillment:** Did the agent actually follow the instructions in the system prompt?
    *   **Summarization & Coherence:** Evaluating the linguistic quality and density of the output.
*   **[Model Monitoring on Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/machine-learning/model-monitoring/overview)** (formerly Vertex AI Model Monitoring): Essential for "Day 2" operations. FDEs set up monitoring to detect **Prediction Drift** and **Feature Attribution** changes in production, ensuring the agentic system doesn't degrade over time as client data evolves.

---

### 🤖 The Enterprise RAG Blueprint
1.  **Ingestion:** Using **[LlamaParse](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/llama_cloud/llama_parse/)** to extract data from complex enterprise PDFs/tables.
2.  **Grounding:** Using **[Agent Search on Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform](https://docs.cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs)** (formerly Vertex AI Search) as a managed RAG engine for semantic retrieval over client data.
3.  **Vector Storage:** High-scale indexing with **[Vector Search on Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/build/vector-search/overview)** (formerly Vertex AI Vector Search).
4.  **Hybrid Search:** Combining semantic vectors with keyword-based BM25 search to satisfy specific industry nomenclature.

## 📡 Air-Gapped & Tactical Edge Deployment
*The hardest FDE work happens where the internet doesn't reach: SCIFs, submarines, forward operating bases, offline factory floors, and regulated on-prem enclaves. Standard cloud playbooks fail here — you must ship the platform, not point at it.*

### 🔒 The Compliance Bedrock
Before you write code, know the classification and the accreditation path. These acronyms drive every architectural choice:
*   **ATO (Authority to Operate):** The signed authorization from a government agency's Authorizing Official permitting a system to run on their network. Achieved via the **[NIST Risk Management Framework](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/about-rmf)** and typically takes 6–18 months.
*   **DoD Impact Levels:** **IL2** (publicly releasable / non-critical unclassified), **IL4** (Controlled Unclassified Information), **IL5** (higher-sensitivity CUI + mission-critical / unclassified National Security Systems), **IL6** (classified up to Secret). Each level dictates which clouds (GCC High, AWS GovCloud, Azure Government) and which network enclaves (NIPRNet, SIPRNet) you can touch.
*   **FedRAMP High vs. Moderate:** Federal civilian equivalent. Most Gen AI services are only FedRAMP Moderate — a hard blocker for many defense workloads. Check the **[FedRAMP Marketplace](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/)** before promising a feature.
*   **STIGs (Security Technical Implementation Guides):** Line-by-line hardening checklists published by DISA for every OS, container image, and database. Your CI must produce STIG-compliant artifacts or ATO will bounce you.
*   **ITAR / EAR:** Export-control regimes. If your model was trained on ITAR-controlled data, its weights themselves are controlled — you cannot ship them to a non-US person, ever.
*   **CMMC 2.0:** The DoD contractor certification. Level 2 is the practical floor for FDE work in the defense industrial base; per DoD Class Deviation 2024-O0013 (May 2024) it currently assesses against **NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2** (110 security requirements). Rev. 3 (May 2024, 97 requirements) is published but not yet the CMMC baseline — rulemaking to adopt it is expected around 2027.

### 📦 Offline Model Weights & Package Mirrors
An air-gapped host cannot `pip install`, `huggingface_hub.download`, or reach `api.openai.com`. Pre-stage everything:
*   **Model Weights:** Ship weights on encrypted physical media (a signed portable disk delivered via courier or a cleared engineer's laptop). SHA-256 verify on arrival, load via **`safetensors`** (not pickle — pickle is an RCE waiting to happen inside a classified enclave).
*   **License & Provenance:** Every weight file needs a signed provenance record: source, license (Apache 2.0? Llama Community? Gemma Terms?), training-data attestation. Auditors will ask, and "we downloaded it from HuggingFace" is not an answer.
*   **Package Mirrors:** Stand up an internal **PyPI mirror** (`devpi`, `bandersnatch`), **npm mirror** (`Verdaccio`), and **APT mirror** (`apt-mirror`). Nothing installs from the public internet — ever. Air-gap `pip.conf` and `~/.npmrc` to point at the mirrors.
*   **CVE Scanning:** Every mirrored artifact runs through **[Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)** or **[Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype)** before it's approved for the enclave. Track vulnerabilities against an offline NVD snapshot that you refresh via manifest-based sync.

### 🐳 Hardened Container Registries
Public Docker Hub and gcr.io are unreachable and untrusted. Ship images through a hardened pipeline:
*   **[Iron Bank](https://p1.dso.mil/products/iron-bank):** The DoD's centralized repository of pre-hardened, STIG-compliant, continuously-scanned container images. If a base image isn't in Iron Bank, it typically can't run on Platform One clusters.
*   **[Harbor](https://goharbor.io/):** The de facto private registry for air-gapped environments — supports image signing (Notary/Cosign), replication, and CVE scanning out of the box.
*   **Image Signing:** Every image signed with **[Cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign)** using an offline root-of-trust key. Kubernetes admission controllers (**[Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/)**, **OPA Gatekeeper**) reject unsigned images at deploy time.
*   **Distroless Bases:** Prefer Google's **`distroless`** images or **`chainguard/static`** — a container with no shell is a container an attacker cannot pivot from.

### 🔁 Sync-Back & Cross-Domain Patterns
Data has to move between the enclave and the outside world — but only in the directions and formats policy allows:
*   **One-Way Data Diodes:** Hardware devices (e.g., **Owl Cyber Defense**, **Fox-IT**) that physically permit data flow in only one direction. Common pattern: model weights flow *into* the enclave, telemetry flows *out*.
*   **Cross-Domain Solutions (CDS):** Accredited software/hardware that mediates transfers between classification levels (e.g., Unclassified → Secret). CDS approval is its own multi-month process — plan for it on the discovery call, not week 12.
*   **Manifest-Based Sync:** Every artifact leaving or entering the enclave has a signed manifest, human-review sign-off, and an immutable audit log. No "background sync" processes.
*   **Redaction Pipelines:** Outbound telemetry passes through a **DLP** stage (regex + ML classifier) that scrubs PII, coordinates, unit designators, and any string matching classified-keyword lists before it hits the low-side.

### ⚙️ The Edge Runtime Stack
Real edge deployments — a Humvee, a factory PLC network, a ship at sea — don't run full GKE. They run lightweight, offline-first Kubernetes:
*   **[K3s](https://k3s.io/) / [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io/) / [k0s](https://k0sproject.io/):** Single-binary Kubernetes distributions designed for edge and disconnected environments.
*   **[GKE on Bare Metal / Google Distributed Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud):** Google's managed-style Kubernetes running inside a customer's own data center or air-gapped enclave, with periodic sync to the control plane.
*   **Local Inference Runtimes:** **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)**, **[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)**, **[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)**, and **[TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM)** for running quantized open-weight models (Gemma, Llama, Mistral) on constrained hardware — including CPU-only or single-GPU nodes.
*   **Store-and-Forward Telemetry:** Assume the network drops for hours. Buffer logs and metrics locally (**Fluent Bit** + local disk WAL), forward opportunistically when connectivity returns.

### 🚨 Air-Gap-Specific Failure Modes
*Things that never happen in the cloud and always happen at a client site:*
*   **Clock Drift:** No NTP means TLS certs silently expire and Kerberos tickets stop minting. Ship a local **Chrony** or **PTP** setup on day one.
*   **Cert Rotation:** You cannot Let's Encrypt. Bake an internal **PKI** (**[HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)**, **step-ca**, or **Smallstep**) into the enclave from day one.
*   **Secrets Management:** Cloud KMS is unreachable. Use **Vault** in HA mode with auto-unseal via HSM, or **[SOPS](https://github.com/getsops/sops)** with age keys for GitOps flows.
*   **The "First Boot" Problem:** How does day-1 configuration get in? Usually via a signed sneakernet ISO delivered by a cleared engineer. Design for this from week one — don't discover it at week twelve.

## 🤝 The "Soft Stack": Consulting & Strategy
*An FDE is a "Technical Diplomat". If you cannot navigate the boardroom, your code will never reach production.*

In the field, you will face **ambiguity**. A CEO might say, *"I want our AI to make us more efficient".* As an FDE, your job is to translate that vagueness into a specific **Technical PRD (Product Requirements Document)**.

### 🧠 The Diagnostic Mindset
When a client asks for a feature, the FDE uses the **"Three Whys"** to find the root business pain:
1.  **"What is the System of Record?"** (Where is the ground truth data? If it's an Excel sheet on someone's desktop, the project is already at risk.)
2.  **"What is the Cost of Inaction?"** (If we don't build this, what happens? This defines the project's priority.)
3.  **"What does 'Day 2' look like?"** (Who maintains this once the FDE leaves? If there is no internal owner, the project will die.)

---

### 📋 The "Forward Deployment" Discovery Checklist
*Before writing a single line of code, you must clear these hurdles:*

#### 🏢 Administrative & Political
- [ ] **The "Champion":** Who is the internal person fighting for this project?
- [ ] **The "Blocker":** Which department (usually IT or Legal) is most likely to stop us?
- [ ] **The Success Metric:** Is success "Lower Latency," "Higher Accuracy," or "Headcount Reduction"?

#### 🔐 Data & Security
- [ ] **Classification:** Is the data PII, PHI, or Secret?
- [ ] **Ingestion:** Is the data "Streaming" (Pub/Sub) or "Batch" (BigQuery transfers)?
- [ ] **Compliance:** Do we need VPC Service Controls or Data Loss Prevention (DLP) masking?

#### 🏗 Infrastructure (The GCP Lens)
- [ ] **Access:** Do we have `Project Editor` or `Owner` roles in the Google Cloud Project?
- [ ] **Connectivity:** Is this a Private GKE cluster? Do we need a Cloud VPN or Interconnect?
- [ ] **Quotas:** Does the client have enough GPU quota (A100/H100) for the models we plan to deploy?

---

### 📐 Strategic Frameworks
*FDEs use these McKinsey-style frameworks to structure technical chaos.*

*   **[The Pyramid Principle](https://medium.com/lessons-from-mckinsey/the-pyramid-principle-f0885dd3c5c7):** **Bottom-Line Up Front (BLUF).** When talking to a CTO, give the conclusion first, then the supporting technical data.
*   **[The MECE Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MECE_principle):** (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive). Ensure your project plan covers all bases without overlapping work.
*   **The Trusted Advisor:** The formula: $Trust = \frac{Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy}{Self-Orientation}$. As an FDE, you must lower your "Self-Orientation" (focusing on the client's win, not your product's features).
*   **The Delta Concept:** Focus entirely on the "Delta"—the specific bridge between what the product does out-of-the-box and what the client needs it to do to be successful.

---

### ✍️ Practical Scoping & Artifacts
*The documents an FDE creates to ensure project survival.*

*   **The SOW (Statement of Work):** This is your shield against "Scope Creep". It defines exactly where your job ends.
*   **The MVA (Minimum Viable Architecture):** Don't over-engineer. Design the simplest version on GCP (e.g., Cloud Run + BigQuery) that proves the value in < 30 days.
*   **The Technical Demo:** An FDE demo is not a feature tour. It is a **Value Narrative**. Show how the data moves from their messy legacy system into a clean AI-driven insight.

### 🚩 Red Flags for FDEs
*If you see these during discovery, escalate immediately:*
1.  **"Data will be ready in 2 weeks".** (It never is.)
2.  **"We don't need a project manager on our side".** (The project will lose direction.)
3.  **"Can we just run this on-prem for now?"** (This usually indicates a deep-seated distrust of Cloud/GCP that will block the project later.)

---

### 🚀 Key Resources for Technical Strategy
*   **[The McKinsey Way](https://www.amazon.com/McKinsey-Way-Ethan-M-Rasiel/dp/0070534489):** Essential for learning "Consultant-speak".
*   **[Good Strategy / Bad Strategy](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-Strategy-Difference/dp/0307886239):** Learning to identify the "crux" of a client's problem.
*   **[Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record):** A critical tool for FDEs to document *why* a certain design choice was made at a client site.

## 📝 The Interview Blackbook & Case Studies

FDE interviews at companies like Palantir, Google, or Scale AI don't just test your coding; they test your **"Delta"**—your ability to bridge the gap between a product and a mission.

### 🛠 The "C.A.S.E". Framework for FDE Interviews
When given a case study, do not start coding. Use this four-step diagnostic approach:
1.  **Clarify:** Ask about data volume, security (PII/PHI), and the "Definition of Done".
2.  **Architect:** Design the data flow from source system to end-user UI using GCP primitives.
3.  **Solve (The Delta):** Identify what the product *doesn't* do out of the box and how you will build the "glue".
4.  **Evaluate:** How do we prove the AI isn't hallucinating? How do we monitor performance?

---

### 🏥 The "Delta" Case Study: Hospital Readmission
**Scenario:** *"A massive hospital chain wants to use our software to predict patient readmission. They have 20 years of data in a legacy SQL Server on-prem. They have zero cloud presence and extreme HIPAA privacy concerns. Walk us through your first 30 days".*

#### The "Awesome" Solution (GCP Focused):
*   **Days 1–7 (Discovery & Trust):**
    *   **Technical:** Run a data profiling audit on the SQL Server. Identify key features (age, diagnosis, last visit).
    *   **Strategy:** Meet with the Chief Medical Officer to define "Readmission" (is it 30 days or 90?). Build rapport with the IT team that feels "threatened" by the cloud move.
*   **Days 8–15 (Secure Landing Zone):**
    *   **Architecture:** Propose a **GCP Landing Zone**. Use **Cloud Storage** for ingestion and **BigQuery** for the data warehouse.
    *   **Security:** Implement **VPC Service Controls** and **Sensitive Data Protection (DLP)** to mask PII before it hits the analytics layer. This satisfies the HIPAA requirement.
*   **Days 16–25 (The Agentic Pipeline):**
    *   **Engineering:** Build a pipeline using **Agent Search** grounded in the patient’s history. 
    *   **The Delta:** Write a custom Python service on **Cloud Run** that pulls real-time patient "vitals" from the SQL Server to update the prediction.
*   **Days 26–30 (Value Validation):**
    *   **Evaluation:** Use **Pairwise Evaluation** (the successor to AutoSxS) to compare the model's predictions against historical outcomes.
    *   **UAT:** Put a simple dashboard in front of 5 doctors. If they don't change their behavior based on the data, the project has failed.

### ⚡ High-Frequency Interview Questions

#### 1. The Data Ingestion Crisis
*   **Question:** "A client has 5PB of data on-prem and needs it in BigQuery in 48 hours for an emergency exercise. How do you do it?"
*   **FDE Answer:** "Internet bandwidth is the bottleneck. I would request a **Google Cloud Transfer Appliance** (high-capacity storage server) to be shipped to the site. While the box is in transit, I’d build the BigQuery schema and partitioning strategy to ensure the data is immediately queryable upon upload".

#### 2. The Hostile Stakeholder
*   **Question:** "The client’s Lead Engineer hates our product and refuses to give you VPC access. How do you handle it?"
*   **FDE Answer:** "This is a trust problem, not a technical one. I’d set up a 1-on-1 to understand their concerns. Often, they fear the product will replace their job. I’d show them how our platform automates the 'grunt work' (ETL/Ops), allowing them to focus on high-level architecture. I’d offer to co-author the initial deployment scripts to give them ownership".

#### 3. Real-Time Latency vs. AI
*   **Question:** "A bank wants real-time fraud detection (<100ms) using an LLM. How do you architect this?"
*   **FDE Answer:** "An LLM is too slow for the primary path. I’d architect a two-tier system: Use a fast, deterministic model (XGBoost on Agent Platform Inference) for the 100ms decision. Then, pass the 'flagged' transactions to a **Gemini-powered agent** running on **Agent Runtime** for an asynchronous, deep-dive explanation that the fraud analyst can read 5 seconds later".

### 📖 Real-World Case Studies to Study
*   **[Palantir vs. COVID-19 (UK NHS)](https://www.palantir.com/uk/healthcare/):** A masterclass in integrating thousands of disparate data sources (beds, staff, PPE) into a single "Operating System" in weeks.
*   **[OpenAI & Morgan Stanley](https://openai.com/customer-stories/morgan-stanley):** How FDEs turned 100,000+ PDFs of financial research into an internal "Assistant" that maintains the bank's strict compliance standards.
*   **[Scale AI & the US Army](https://scale.com/blog/scale-ai-dod-expand-army-rd-partnership):** Deploying computer vision models to the "Tactical Edge"—processing satellite and drone data where internet is intermittent.
*   **[Google Cloud & Ford](https://corporate.ford.com//articles/products/ford-and-google-to-accelerate-auto-innovation/):** Using GCP to modernize manufacturing and deploy AI across the supply chain.

---

### 🚀 Pro-Tip for the Repo:
Incorporate a **"Case Study Rubric"**—a checklist of what a "Senior" vs. "Junior" answer looks like.
*   *Junior:* Focuses only on the code/Python script.
*   *Senior:* Mentions security, cost-optimization (GCP FinOps), and stakeholder buy-in.

## 📂 Artifact Templates (Copy-Paste)

In the field, your documentation is your contract. Use these templates to define reality, manage expectations, and prove value.

### 1. The "Site Survey" (Discovery Report)
*Used in Week 1 to document the "messy reality" before you start building.*

```markdown
### 🕵️ Site Survey: [Client Name] - [Project Name]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD | **Lead FDE:** [Your Name]

#### 1. The Data Landscape (The Ground Truth)
- **Source Systems:** [e.g., On-prem SQL Server 2016, SAP HANA, Unstructured Sharepoint]
- **Data Gravity:** [e.g., 5TB total, growing at 50GB/day. Must stay within EU regions.]

#### 2. Technical & Security Constraints
- **Identity:** [e.g., Client uses Okta for OIDC. Need to integrate with GCP IAM.]
- **Connectivity:** [e.g., No public internet. Must use Cloud Interconnect + Private Google Access.]
- **Exfiltration Risks:** VPC Service Controls (VPC SC) are active. Need to request perimeter bridges.

#### 3. The "Delta" (The Gap)
- **Product Gap:** Core product doesn't support the client's proprietary `.xyz` file format.
- **Proposed Glue:** Build a custom GCF (Cloud Function) parser to convert `.xyz` to Parquet.

#### 4. The Quick Win (Week 2 Objective)
- [e.g., Stand up an Agent Search instance on the 'Policy' dataset to prove 90% retrieval accuracy.]
```

## 📖 The FDE Glossary

### 🛸 Foundational Concepts (The "Forward" in FDE)
*   **The Delta:** Pioneered by Palantir, this refers to the "gap" between what a product does out-of-the-box and the specific engineering required to make it solve a client's mission.
*   **Productized Consulting:** The philosophy of solving a client’s unique problem through code that can eventually be abstracted back into the core product features.
*   **Embedded Engineering:** Unlike a consultant who "advises," an FDE is embedded—they have client credentials, sit in client Slack channels, and ship code directly into the client’s production environment.
*   **Last-Mile Integration:** The complex work of stitching a modern SaaS/AI platform into legacy, often undocumented, "messy" enterprise systems.

### 🏗 The Technical & Infra Stack (GCP & Beyond)
*   **Air-Gap / Tactical Edge:** Environments with zero or intermittent internet connectivity (Common in Defense/Energy). Requires local container registries and offline model weights. See the [Air-Gapped & Tactical Edge Deployment](#-air-gapped--tactical-edge-deployment) section for the full playbook.
*   **VPC Service Controls (VPC SC):** A GCP security perimeter that prevents data exfiltration by restricting access to Google-managed services (like BigQuery or Agent Platform) only from authorized networks.
*   **Hardening:** The process of moving a prototype from "it works on my machine" to "it meets SOC2/HIPAA security standards," including encryption at rest/transit and least-privilege IAM roles.
*   **Shadow IT:** Unauthorized tools or "rogue" databases used by client employees. This is often where the "cleanest" and most useful data actually lives.
*   **System of Record (SoR):** The authoritative data source for a given piece of information (e.g., SAP for finance, Salesforce for CRM). FDEs must identify this to avoid building on "stale" data replicas.

### 🤖 The AI & Agentic Layer (ADK & Evals)
*   **Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform (formerly Vertex AI):** Google's umbrella brand (announced at Google Cloud Next '26) for the full agent-building stack — Model Garden, Agent Studio, Agent Runtime, Agent Search, Vector Search, Evals, Model Monitoring, and more. Existing Vertex AI SDKs, APIs (`aiplatform.v1beta1.*`), and billing are unchanged; only the product-level branding and console UI have moved.
*   **Agent Runtime (formerly Vertex AI Agent Engine):** The managed, auto-scaling runtime for deploying agents built with ADK, LangChain, LangGraph, or any Python framework. Sits under "Scale" in the Agent Platform console alongside Memory Bank and Sessions.
*   **Agents CLI:** Launched in Alpha at Google Cloud Next '26 (April 22, 2026), an opinionated CLI + seven-skill package (`google-agents-cli-workflow`, `-scaffold`, `-adk-code`, `-eval`, `-deploy`, `-publish`, `-observability`) that turns any AI coding tool (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Codex, Antigravity) into an ADK-lifecycle expert — and also runs standalone from the terminal. Installed via `uvx google-agents-cli setup`.
*   **Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol:** An open standard used in the **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)** that allows autonomous agents to discover, hand off tasks, and communicate with one another across systems.
*   **Workflow Agents:** Deterministic agents in ADK (`SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, `LoopAgent`) that follow fixed logic paths rather than relying on an LLM to "plan" the next step.
*   **Grounding:** The process of connecting an LLM to "Ground Truth" data (via RAG or Google Search) to ensure its responses are factual and cite-able.
*   **Pairwise Evaluation (formerly AutoSxS):** A GCP-native evaluation method where an "Autorater" LLM compares two model outputs and provides a structured judgment on which is better and why. Runs inside **Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform Evals** (formerly Vertex AI Gen AI Evaluation Service).
*   **Faithfulness (RAGAS Metric):** A measure of how much the answer is derived *only* from the retrieved context, essentially a "hallucination score".

### 🤝 Strategic Consulting (Boardroom Language)
*   **SOW (Statement of Work):** The legally binding "fence" around your project. If it’s not in the SOW, it’s "Scope Creep".
*   **MSA (Master Services Agreement):** The high-level contract between your company and the client that defines the legal relationship before any specific work starts.
*   **Cost of Inaction (CoI):** A strategic argument used to drive projects forward by quantifying how much money/efficiency the client loses every day they *don't* deploy the solution.
*   **UAT (User Acceptance Testing):** The "moment of truth" where actual client employees use the tool. If they don't "accept" it, the project isn't done, regardless of how good the code is.
*   **Day 2 Operations:** Everything that happens after the FDE leaves. Includes monitoring, retraining models, and training the client's internal "Run Team".
